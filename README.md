The project I did, is to implement a weighted undirected graph. I implemented it by HashMap data structure, to recived a good complexity.
I have a class with methods of adding and removing nodes, adding and removing edges, etc. Moreover, I have a class of algorithms that can 
make a deep copy of the graph, check if the graph is connected, find the shortest path distance, return a list of nodes in the shortest path,
and in addition has save and load methods.
