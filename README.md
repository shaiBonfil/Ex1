The project I did, is to implement a weighted undirected graph. I implemented it by using a HashMap data structure, to recived a good time complexity. I have a class with methods for adding and removing nodes, adding and removing edges, etc. Moreover, I have a class of algorithms that can make a deep copy of the graph, check if the graph is connected, find the shortest path from one node to another and return a list of nodes in the shortest path or the distance between them, and in addition has save and load methods used to write and read the graph to and from files.
